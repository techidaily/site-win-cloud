## RED DJ Station 3 Karaoke Mastery Tutorials - Essential Techniques for Aspiring DJs

[![](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/red3karaoke-coverimage.jpg?resize=530%2C298&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/red3karaoke-coverimage.jpg?fit=530%2C298&ssl=1 "red3karaoke-coverimage")

The totally redesigned[RED Mobile 3 DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) upgrade dropped a couple weeks ago, complete with a new _“side-list”_ that doubles as a singers list for hosting karaoke.

RED Mobile 3 and the previous RED Mobile 2 version have always made it fun and easy to mix music — with simple navigation and features designed around the needs of Mobile DJs. The ability to play karaoke files and output lyrics to a secondary display has been included in RED Mobile 2 from the initial launch, but RED Mobile 3 makes hosting easier with the new side-list/singers list.

Offering a karaoke package with your mobile DJ services can help boost your bottom line, and help you land more gigs you wouldn’t have been previously capable of performing. RED Mobile 3 is a great fit for DJs that mix music and karaoke, while our flagship DJ software — [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) — has the added benefit of video mixing.

In the video tutorial below we demonstrates how to setup your secondary display for lyrics-only output, how to add songs to the side-list with singer names and how to load karaoke songs and play them. This is how you host karaoke with RED Mobile 3.
