### Through Infected Files

One way malware can install itself on your computer is through an infected file. This could be a program you download, an email attachment, or even a photo or video you receive. The file appears normal to you, but it’s actually hiding malicious code that will install the malware on your machine if you open it.

### Through Drive-By Downloads

Another common way malware can end up on your computer is through what’s called a [drive-by download.](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) This happens when you visit an infected website and the malicious code on the site automatically downloads and installs itself on your machine without you even knowing it.

### Through Fake Updates

Yet another way malware can install itself is through fake updates. You might see a pop-up window telling you to update your software, but instead of installing the legitimate update, the malicious code installs itself. This can happen with your operating system, web browser, and other programs.

### Through Malicious Links

Malware can also install itself through malicious links. These are links that appear to go to one place but actually redirect you to a malicious site that will install malware on your machine. This can happen if you click on a link in an email, instant message, or social media post.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### By Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Operating Systems or Software

Another way malware can install itself is by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems or software. This is when the malicious code takes advantage of a flaw in the system to get itself installed. Once it’s on your machine, it can do all sorts of damage, from stealing your personal information to holding your files hostage for ransom.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Through Social Engineering

Finally, malware can also be installed through social engineering. This is when someone tricks you into doing something that will let the malware onto your machine. For example, they might pose as a [tech support person](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and convince you to install a program that will give them remote access to your computer. Or they might send you an email that looks like it’s from your bank, asking you to click on a link to update your account information. If you do, you’ll be taken to a fake website that will install malware on your machine.
