## Is My Phone Connected to Another Device?

Here are the steps to check for any unauthorized access or link to your phone by logging on to Sign-in account, Cloud storage or by means of any security threats.

### Google Account (For Android Users)

As an Android aficionado, your Google Account is your primary ally. This account is a central hub where your data syncs across all your devices. Want to figure out who’s been dipping into your Google lifeline? Simply visit <https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity>

Voila! You’re now privy to a list of connected devices that have accessed your Google Account. You can also access details such as when and where these devices accessed your account. For a deep dive, click on an individual session to uncover more about the app or service accessing your information.

### Apple Account (For iPhone Users)

For iPhone fanatics, your Apple ID is your key to identifying any unauthorized device connections. Simply open the Settings app, tap on your Apple ID (which would be your name), and you’ll see a list of devices synced to your iPhone. Spot an unfamiliar face? Tap on its name and select Remove from Account. It’s as simple as that!

### Spy Apps – The Invisible Invaders

But what if your device connection isn’t following the usual protocol?[Spy Apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), often marketed as Employee Monitoring or Child Tracking apps, could be surreptitiously hiding in your app list. If you identify one that you haven’t authorized, it’s time to show it the door!

Here’s the catch – some of these apps might be playing a clever game of hide and seek. They might not appear in your installed apps list, or they could be impersonating under a generic name. For Android devices, [inspect the Device Administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) section for any hidden culprits.

### Cloud Storages – Your Personal Safehouse

If you’re using cloud storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive, it’s high time for a quick audit. Inspect the active sessions and devices. An unfamiliar device could be snooping on your personal photos and documents by linking to your account.
