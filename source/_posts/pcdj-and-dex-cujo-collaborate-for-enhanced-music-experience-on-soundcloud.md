[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) announced today, Thursday, October 19th, 2018, at the Amsterdam Dance Event ([ADE](https://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/live/)) that [PCDJ DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) users will soon have in-app access to SoundCloud’s massive 190 million song catalog.

SoundCloud is the world’s largest open audio platform, powered by a connected community of creators, listeners and curators on the pulse of what’s new, now and next in culture. Founded in 2007, SoundCloud empowers the world’s audio creators with the best tools, services and resources to build and grow their careers. With over 190 million tracks from 20 million creators heard in 190 countries, what’s next in music is first on SoundCloud.

What this new partnership means for DEX 3 DJs is in-app access to SoundCloud’s massive music catalog via their $9.99-a-month SoundCloud Go+ subscription. The Go+ subscription provides subscribers with access to 190 million tracks from more than 20 million creators around the world, with offline sync, no advertising, and [high quality audio streaming](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2018/10/17/elevate-listening-experience-high-quality-audio-now-included-soundcloud-go-subscription-plans/)–all for $9.99/€9.99 per month.

**Kerry Trainor, SoundCloud CEO, had this to say about DJ Software integration:**

> “Until recently, digital workflows for DJs were limited to downloads and physical media, but streaming workflows are the future,” said **Kerry Trainor, Chief Executive Officer, SoundCloud**. “SoundCloud is committed to empowering creators with the best tools and resources to grow their careers, which is why we are excited to partner with these leading companies to help DJs take their workflow to the next level. Through these partnership, DJs will have the largest, most diverse streaming music catalog ever assembled instantly accessible within the tools they use everyday.”

Needless to say we’re exited to bring SoundCloud support to DEX 3 DJs. The ability to search, stream, and even cache files to your hard drive for offline playback (no internet required), from SoundCloud’s platform furthers our promise to you in creating the most complete, all-in-one entertainment software solution available for DJs and venues alike. With SoundCloud’s mix of user generated content and popular music DEX 3 users won’t just have the hits, but unique tracks they can integrate into their mix sets.

DEX 3 integration of SoundCloud Go+ will be released to the public (very) early 2019\. Stay tuned in and we’ll let you know when the DEX 3 + SoundCloud is ready for a test spin!
