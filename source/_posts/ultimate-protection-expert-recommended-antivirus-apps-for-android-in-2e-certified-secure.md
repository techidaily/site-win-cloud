Avast Antivirus for Android is a feature-rich app that has several useful functions. It protects you against a variety of malware and viruses. Avast would instantly alert you when you install spyware infected apps on your device. It also protects you against phishing emails, SMS, phone calls, and other infected websites. The antitheft feature allows you to remotely wipe and lock your device in case someone steals it.

There is also some impressive performance improving features, including a junk cleaner to free up storage space and a ‘RAM boost’, which intends to speed up your device.

Previously, the app uses to be paid, but now it comes free of cost. However, you would have to deal with continuous ads if you want the service at no charge. You can also opt for the paid version to get rid of them. Additionally, the paid version also provides an app lock that asks you to input a pin before opening any app. The feature comes handy if malware tries to open sensitive applications like a banking app.

### Key Features of Avast Antivirus for Android

* **VPN** – helps you to hide your online activities from the information hunting services.

Some more noteworthy features include the bundled VPN. However, it only allows you to browse 200 MB data per day. You also get the antitheft feature enabling you to wipe and lock your device if someone steals it.

The application provides all this stuff at a minimal cost of $1.49 per month. Still, if you aren’t confident about the protection, you can always take a trial run for 14-days.
