## What are the causes of File Explorer Keep Opening?

Frankly, there is not a particular cause of this issue. However, the following are the possible reasons that can cause it.

* **A bug in the Windows** might have caused File Explorer to misbehave, and it is not getting the command correctly. This is usually the main cause of File Exploring popping.
* There might be some **Corrupted Files** present on your system that have caused this error in your display.
* There might be some **loose connections with your peripheral** that is misleading the Autoplay to launch the File Explorer randomly. A loose connection can lead Autoplay to re-launch some files or folders frequently, thereby, letting File Explorer open randomly. However, this would only happen if Autoplay is turned ON on your device.
* Another reason could be that your device got **infected with a malware** that is causing ‘File Explorer keep opening’ error on your system.

## How To Fix “File Explorer Keeps Opening” Error On Windows 10?

In the previous section, we got to know about the possible causes of the File Explorer popping up. Now we can plan your steps to fix the error. Let us see how we can do that.

### **Restart the Windows File Explorer**

With lots of processes running side by side sometimes, it may cause misbehavior to one or more processes, including the File Explorer. So if File Explorer is misbehaving, you can try restarting so that the auto-opening stops. Here is how you can do it:

1. **Open Task Manager**  
Open the **Task Manager** by right-clicking on the taskbar and choosing Task Manager![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. **Search File Explorer**

Now in the running processes, search for **File Explorer** or **Windows Explorer**, depending on the version of Windows you are using.
3. **End File Explorer**  
Right-click on it and choose **End task** from the context menu.![End File Explorer](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/End-File-Explorer.jpg)

### **Remove the Autoplay**

If you came across ‘File Explorer keep opening’ problem when you try to connect an external hard disk or USB drive, then it may be because of Autoplay. The connection might be loose, and each time your external device is connected, the Autoplay opens up the File Explorer, creating this problem. 

[How to Fix your Computer like Service Repair Guys](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

This is how you can disable the Autoplay:

1\. Go to **Control Panel** by searching it on the Windows search box.

2\. Now change the default **View by** to Large icons or Small icons as per your preference.

![Change Default View](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Control-Panel-View-By.png)

3\. Now you would see many options and in those choose **Autoplay** and click on it.

4\. In the next Window, to disable the Autoplay, uncheck the **Use Autoplay for all media and devices** and click on **Save.**

![Disable Autoplay](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Disable-Autoplay.png)

### **Repair Corrupted System Files**
