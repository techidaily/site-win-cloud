## Understanding Gstatic

Gstatic is a domain used by Google to hold static content like JS libraries, style sheets, etc. It is not a virus but a misconception. Gstatic enables the fast loading of Google services like opening images, JavaScript, or CSS. It also reduces bandwidth usage and verifies a better connection to the internet. Gstatic has various subdomains that work for particular purposes. It is safe and legal. 

Numerous Gstatic domains have been the cause of several cyberattacks and have been reported as the culprit by several users. So, if you get any pop-ups or irregular notifications on your device, scan it for malware or virus. There are many fake Gstatic sites created nowadays. And these sites are used by them to install adware or viruses on users’ devices. It may happen that due to an infected virus, you will be redirected to different domains. This may lead you to any fake or sponsored pages that may steal your private information. All these do not occur because of Gstatic; they may happen due to any other adware program installed on your device.

## How Does Gstatic Virus Creep Into Your Device?

Normally, users install such unwanted adware or viruses unintentionally. Users are sometimes tricked or redirected to intrusive ad pages developed by frauds to steal your data or generate revenue from such unfair practices. This form of installing viruses or any other adware into your device is called Bundling. It is a deceptive marketing method where the frauds make use of third-party software to disclose information or to commit fraudulent activity by hacking or getting access to the user’s data. So, these viruses get installed into your device by clicking on intrusive ads or any link. The intrusive links may also contain gambling, pornography, adult dating, or unwanted content. 

Moreover, it is good not to use suspicious sites or third-party software installers or downloaders. Always use trustworthy and direct links or sites to download and check advanced or custom options while downloading to install free software. This way, only you can protect your online privacy and personal or sensitive details.
