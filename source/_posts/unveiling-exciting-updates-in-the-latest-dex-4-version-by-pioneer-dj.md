## DEX 4 Feature Highlights:

* SLIP mode for loops, hot cues, scratching, reverse, pause  
   * loops – all loops now act as loop rolls  
   * hot cue points – these act as momentary cue points (eg. only while the button/pad is being pressed)  
   * scratch – after scratching is complete the track will resume as if there was no scratch  
   * reverse – same as with scratch  
   * pause (with turntable stop effect)
* QUANTIZE / Snap-to-beat mode for Cues, Loops, searching through the track  
   * this affects: loop auto/manual mode (snap-to-beat and size quantizing), cue set quantizing, seek (while playing) quantizing  
   * from compatible controllers the Quantize function can be controlled per deck or globally (all decks)
* brand-new time-stretching and pitch-shifting (courtesy of zplane’s Elastique Pro)
* Loop rolls
* Slicer and Loop Slicer (fully quantized, including rolls)
* Pitch Play
* Markers: cue points and loops are now unified (merged) into ‘markers’ (that do both). Think of them as bookmarks or points of interest basically.  
   * markers can have custom colors and names (right click to edit them) – these are also displayed on compatbile controllers (eg. the RANE FOUR shows both the color and the name/text of a marker)  
   * right click no longer clears cue points (markers); you can still do it using the dedicated X (delete cue) button or by a long-press (a couple of seconds; this is disabled when in SLIP mode)
* PADs section with 8 pads mode selection (Markers, Loop Roll, Slicer, Slicer Loop, Sampler, Beat Jump, Pitch Play, Stems)
* instant loops (with pre-selected value)
* fully manual loops – disable quantize and manually control the start and end/size of a loop (set the in and out points without snap-to-beat or quantize)
* manual loop adjustment – when a loop is active you can adjust its left/in point, right/out point or move it left or right using the jog-wheel of a compatible controller or the user interface  
If a controller doesn’t have dedicated loop adjustment buttons you can use Shift + Cue point 1,2,3 on a controller – NOTE: when NOT inside a loop this will delete the cue point being pressed (normal functionality)  
Shift + Cue 1 enables the left point (loop in) editing mode  
Shift + Cue 2 enables the right point (loop out) editing mode  
Shift + Cue 3 enables the position (moving) editing mode (eg. both left and right points (loop in + out) are moved thus moving the whole loop)  
Use jog-wheel search/move mode to adjust the loop – keep Shift pressed and move the jog-wheel to the direction needed (and the amount needed) – when NOT inside a loop this will search/move through the track itself (normal functionality)  
While it is a lot more cumbersome than using a controller, on the user interface itself you can also right-click on the loop -/+ (half/double loop) buttons to enable editing mode and then right-click on the loop (move loop) buttons to adjust the point
* turntable slow start/stop motor effect (0.0 – 5.0 seconds)
* fuzzy key matching / key mixing – it will achieve key sync with minimal key/pitch shifting (none, +/-1 or +/-2 semitones max)  
this allows key mixing with just a +/- 1 (or max +/- 2) semitones key shift; see https://www.digitaldjtips.com/fuzzy-keymixing-the-new-way-to-dj/
* new controller: RANE Four

## Other features:

* added new Audio Routing options for Booth (output) and Record (input)
* added software send/return FX useful for external mixers (or controlleres with hardware DSP mixers) that allow for software processed FX (the external hardware sends us a signal to apply FX to, we process it and then we send it back)
* we no longer apply EQ for external mixer mode (so we don’t double-EQ)
* cross-fading when looping or changing the current position (seek/search through the track) – this sounds a LOT smoother
* added support for .webm video files
* added prevent the screen and system to enter sleep mode
* always-in-sync option (“Use sync-lock when possible”) for SYNC button is now disabled by default (for new installs)
* removed brake feature (use turntable slow pause/stop effect instead)
* removed setting: “Use Slip mode for looping” (use true Slip mode now)
* modified setting: “Time-stretch quality” is now more granular and you choose between: Standard quality (fast), Better quality, Best quality (slow)
* new setting: “Show audio peak load instead of average CPU load”. You can use this in diagnosing audio disruptions/overloads such as glitches, stutters, pops and clicks resulting from an excessively low latency setting, an overly high time-stretch quality setting, or simply an underperforming/slow computer.
* removed setting: “Cutoff Filter Mode” – the filter is now always set to LowPass & HighPass
* WASAPI improvements when resampling is needed (eg. the audio card is set at 48000 Hz and we need to resample from 44100 Hz)
* searching/seeking through the track is now quantized to one bar (when playing)
* Beatsource/Beatport: changed name from “Offline Locker” to “Offline Library”
* TIDAL: Offline Mode
* reimplemented slow pitch/tempo reset, pitch/tempo bend
* improved stability

**_Stay tuned, we expect to drop DEX 4 very soon!_**
