The recently released and totally redesigned [DJ DEX app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dj-dex-the-dj-mixing-app/id514748680?mt=8) for iPad has just received an update that includes multi-touch support for all features. This means you can apply effects using the X/Y pad while simultaneously making other adjustments, such as swiping the crossfader. This will allow DJs more finite control over how they mix music with DJ DEX.

We’ve also lifted the hood and did a little tinkering to optimize existing features for even tighter overall performance. DJ DEX is an adept iPad DJ mixing application that you can confidently use as your primary backup or as your main rig of live performance at your events.

_**DJ DEX app Pro Tip:**_  DJ DEX supports iPad supported multi-channel USB audio interfaces. What this means for DJs is by using one, you have the added benefit of headphone pre-fade listening (cuing). Use either a multi-channel audio interface (such as this one) or a class-compliant iPad-supported DJ controller for both headphone cuing support and tactile control over all DJ DEX features.
