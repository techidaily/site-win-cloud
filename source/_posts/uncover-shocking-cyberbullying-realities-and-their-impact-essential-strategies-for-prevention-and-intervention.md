## What is Cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is a type of harassment that happens through electronic means. Social media, emails, and even websites can serve as platforms for cyberbullying. Moreover, bullies take advantage of the victims’ vulnerability. It may include perceived flaws or intimate information.

McAfee’s 2014 survey shows that nearly [87% of kids and teens witnessed an act of cyberbullying](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2014/q2/20140603-01.aspx). Sadly, 24% of youth report that they do not know what to do in the event of being harassed or bullied online.

Classic causes of bullying still exist such as appearance, race, religion, and sexuality. However, other reasons arise in research about cyberbullying. The McAfee study reports that 50% of respondents were involved in an argument because of something they posted online. The tendency of the youth to overshare makes them very vulnerable.

Only 61% of youth have their privacy protection enabled in their social media accounts. Moreover, 52% do not turn off their location services on mobile devices. Fourteen percent even post their home addresses online. Children are also less likely to have their parents within their online circle of connections.

## Types of Cyberbullying

There are countless types of cyberbullying. Children receive threats online all the time.
