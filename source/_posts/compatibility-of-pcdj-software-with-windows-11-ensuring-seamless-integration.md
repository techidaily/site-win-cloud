## Compatibility of PCDJ Software with Windows 11: Ensuring Seamless Integration

[![PCDJ Windows 11 Support](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/win11-pcdj-support.jpg?resize=845%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/win11-pcdj-support.jpg?fit=1030%2C579&ssl=1 "PCDJ Windows 11 Support")

Microsoft is rolling out [Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/introducing-windows-11/) and PCDJ customers want to know – are [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [LYRX](https://www.lyrxkaraoke.com), and [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) supported?

After extensive testing, development has given their approval – our top DJ software and karaoke software applications are ready to roll with Windows 11\. This also includes the various built-in streaming services ([Beatport & Beatsource LINK](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [SoundCloud Go+](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [Party Tyme Karaoke](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), and [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) – with more on the way) and our new [KSR (karaoke singer request)](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) web-app.

With some of our Windows test machines, overall performance was improved after upgrading to Windows 11\. However, the new Microsoft OS does require a more powerful machine than Windows 10, so be sure to [check system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications) before upgrading.

**One _very_ important note:** if you’re using a [DJ controller](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and/or an external USB pro audio interface, be sure to check with the manufacturer to ensure the device is also supported under Windows 11 (in some cases, new drivers may be required).

If you are running an older, outdated version of any of our live performance applications, please install the latest updates from their corresponding [support page](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/). (install with your existing version closed to update).

Happy mixing and hosting with **Windows 11**!
