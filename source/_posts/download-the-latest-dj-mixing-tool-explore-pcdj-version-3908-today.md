**DEX 3.9.0.8 is now available for download — including a new 64bit public beta version for Windows (New 64bit version update posted 12/1/17 at 4PM EST)!**

DEX 3.9.0.8 is the second release of our top **DJ mixing software** solution this month and comes with a number of feature improvements and significant performance optimizations, as well as a freshly supported DJ controller and two new features.

If you’re a Windows DJ computer user what should really move your meter is the first 64bit release of [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) for Windows (the MAC version has been 64bit for some time). While it’s considered a public beta at this time we do not anticipate any issues running it on a 64bit machine. 64bit support means better overall threading of resources (memory usage), smoother operation and improved stability.

The[Numark DJ2Go2](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) map is also included in the 3.9.0.8 update (DJs no longer need to download/install the map manually) and DJs can ‘unload’ a deck by right-clicking on the load button.

If you’re an existing DEX 3 user we strongly suggest updating to our latest and greatest release below. As with all DEX 3 updates version 3.9.0.8 is free for existing DEX 3 customers and will install directly over-top your existing version, leaving all your playlists and settings intact. **_#MixEverything_**
