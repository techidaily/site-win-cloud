### **The PCDJ Blog â€“ Just Our Spin On Things**

**Welcome Back!**

**Our goal here is to regularly provide you with some insight into not only what weâ€™re up to here at PCDJ, but all things Digital DJ, Karaoke Software, and otherwise entertainment industry related.** Youâ€™ll receive input from various PCDJ team members and guest writers almost daily, including myself Ryan Sherr.

Iâ€™ve personally been with PCDJ for the past 13 years, and I like to think I know quite a bit about our little yet booming industryâ€¦I hope to share some of that knowledge with you.

**First a warning;** weâ€™ll be the first to admit we (I!) failed creative writing in high-school â€“ but this blog isnâ€™t necessarily about telling a story, itâ€™s about us, the music, and the people that drive this business and industry.

With that said, weâ€™ve been a busy team here in sunny Clearwater Florida. We recently released our DJ DEX app for your ipad, a true DJ software mixing application you can actually gig with. Over labor day I threw our families annual backyard BBQ for a few friends and family, and spent close to 2 hours mixing and taking the odd request (trust me, odd is the perfect adjective, my family has a very eclectic taste in tunes).

**I can honestly say the App performed really well and that this type of gathering is the perfect environment for the iPad DJ.** I think it would be amiss to ignore the iPad and other tablets as the future of this business. They still have a way to go in terms of power and easy DJ controller connectivity, but I think weâ€™re closer than most thing in seeing iPads or the like as fixtures in clubs and event halls everywhere.

**Until then of course weâ€™re still focusing our development efforts on PCDJ DEX 2 and RED Mobile 2.** Iâ€™m happy to announce, and Iâ€™m sure some very patient PCDJ customers will agree, we have a fantastic update for both DJ software (and video mixing) applications coming this month.

To throw you a small bone, video transitions and video effects will be part of the PCDJ DEX 2 release, which have been highly requested by our users (and subsequently most of our employees). While I canâ€™t elaborate yet on other new additions or feature tweaks, I will say that weâ€™ve been listening to your requests and wants and taking them into consideration â€“ **I think youâ€™ll find this next update our most sound and easy-to-use release to date.**

**Ok kids, Iâ€™m off to test our latest beta version ðŸ™‚ Please check back soon, and your feedback and comments are always welcome!**
