## Latest Android Virus List

Cybercriminals download ordinary apps from Google Play, add malicious code to them, and then submit the modified versions to Google Play with a new name. The functionality indicated in the description of the apps may still be present, thus users may not even be aware that a vulnerability exists.

Here are the latest malware types and respective apps that are infiltrating Android devices and corrupting them.

### Vultur: The Shape-Shifting Banking Malware

Vultur was first identified in 2021\. Fast forward to 2024, and Vultur has evolved, morphing into an even larger threat as [reported by the NCC group](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/newsroom/ncc-groups-fox-it-releases-new-tech-blog-analyzing-the-vultur-android-malware/).

Once primarily a banking malware, Vultur has now gained new capabilities that give it greater control over your Android device. So, how does it find its way into your smartphone? The answer lies in social engineering. Cybercriminals are becoming savvier, masquerading Vultur as a seemingly harmless app – the trusted McAfee Security. 

Once it has gained access, your device becomes a playground for these cyber outlaws. They can manipulate your device, pilfer your credentials, and mainly target your banking apps. So, the next time you’re downloading an app, bear in mind that appearances can be deceiving—or in this case, McAfee.

### HiddenAds Malware: The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing

Ever found yourself dealing with an app that just wouldn’t stop displaying aggressive ads, leaving you baffled as to which app is the culprit? Allow us to introduce you to the world of HiddenAds malware.

These sly little programs camouflage themselves as mobile games, infiltrate your device, and then, true to their name—they go into hiding. They either mimic the Google Play Store’s icon or become invisible altogether. Once they’ve settled in, they bombard you with ads, turning your device into a mobile billboard.

### Android.Mobidash: The Uninvited Guest

Next up on our list is Android.Mobidash, the elusive malware that loves to make a grand entrance once you’ve let your guard down. How so? Well, MobiDash employs an intriguing modus operandi—it lies dormant for about three days post-installation before it starts displaying pop-up ads.

However, there’s a silver lining. MobiDash is more of an annoying, unwelcome guest than a damaging menace. So, while it might be a bother, it doesn’t pose any serious threat to your device.

### Pandora.2: The Trojan Horse

Last but certainly not least, we have Pandora.2, a trojan malware that’s been causing a stir since the onset of 2024\. This trojan covertly compromises Android devices during firmware updates or when installing apps for viewing pirated video content.

What’s truly alarming? Pandora.2 uses your device as a pawn in its botnet chess game, initiating DDoS attacks. It’s a descendant of the notorious Linux.Mirai trojan, which has been instigating DDoS attacks against big players like GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb, and more since 2016.

### CherryBIOS and FakeTrade

According to an [article by Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en%5Fus/research/23/g/cherryblos-and-faketrade-android-malware-involved-in-scam-campai.html), two new related Android malware families, CherryBlos and FakeTrade, have been discovered. These malware families are involved in cryptocurrency-mining and financially-motivated scam campaigns targeting Android users.

The first campaign leveraged popular social networking platforms to promote fraudulent services, with the advertisements pointing to phishing websites that trick users into downloading and installing malicious Android apps. The downloaded malware CherryBlos can steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials and replace victims’ addresses while they make withdrawals.

Meanwhile, another campaign that employed several fraudulent money-earning apps involved the FakeTrade malware. These apps claim to be e-commerce platforms that promise increased income for users via referrals and top-ups. However, users will be unable to withdraw their funds when they attempt to do so.

### Unsupported Compression

This is not a malware but a penetrate malware bypassing detection tools. According to a [blog post by Zimperium](https://www.zimperium.com/blog/over-3000-android-malware-samples-using-multiple-techniques-to-bypass-detection/), a cybersecurity company, threat actors are using Android Package (APK) files with unknown or unsupported compression methods to elude malware analysis. Zimperium found 3,300 apps leveraging such compression algorithms in the wild. Most of these samples are corrupted beyond the point that the OS is able to load them. However, their team identified 71 malicious samples that the Android OS is able to load properly.

### Joker Spyware

Joker is a spyware that gathers contact lists, SMS messages, and details about affected devices. Joker also has the capacity to register the device for premium services without the owner’s consent, monetising the malware infection.

### Harly Trojan

Harly obtains data about the user’s device, especially data about the mobile network, in an improper manner. The entire payload is contained within the app by the Harly family of Trojans, which employ various techniques to decode and launch it.

### **FakeDolphin**

FakeDolphin is a malicious program that gives Dolphin browser as the alternative to your default browser, most commonly Google Chrome. The Dolphin browser is a fake browser containing a Trojan that automatically sign-up users up for its services without their permission. Generally, users are forced to download the Dolphin browser by unintentional redirection.

### **GinMaster**

GinMaster, also known as the GingerMaster, was first detected in 2011\. Today it comprises 6% of the total malware attacks on Android. After entering the device, the GinMaster installs its root shell deep into the device partition to remain undetected. In the last decade, cybercriminals have created so many varieties of the GinMaster and used it for various malicious purposes like stealing sensitive information, remotely controlling the device, spying, and more. The reason GinMaster is spreading rapidly is that it attaches itself to legitimate applications, and users unintentionally install it with them.

### **ExoBot**

ExoBot is one of the most dangerous banking Android malware. Though it was particularly detected for Bank Austria, it has various other forms as well for other popular banks of the world. After the infiltration, the ExoBot would put a legit-looking icon of the banking app so that users click on it and enter their credentials. The ExoBot is widely used for banking credentials stealing, data theft, and other phishing.

### **Android Police Virus**

Android Police Virus (APV) is a type of Ransomware. It can block the entire system and encrypt all the files and applications. The Android Police Virus is the newly designed Android version of the famous FBI virus.

It is essential to know that most of these apps are also available on Google Play Store. Unfortunately, because of a library of millions of apps, it is pretty challenging for Google to keep the Play Store free of malicious apps.

If your phone carries one or multiple apps from the above list, it is advised to immediately get rid of them and scan your system with a robust antimalware program.
