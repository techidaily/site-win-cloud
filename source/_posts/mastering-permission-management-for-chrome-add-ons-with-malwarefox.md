### When you click the extension

If you choose this option, the extension will not be able to see any data on any website. To allow it to access the information on a site you have to click on the extension. Then it will be able to access the data on the current tab website. This option is helpful in reducing the system resource usage as well as protecting your confidential information.

### On {a Website}

If you want the extension to work only on a particular website, then choose this option. The extension will be able to read and change data on the website that you opened in the current tab. It will not work on other websites.

## How will this Feature help you?

Well, if you are like me who has almost half a dozen of extensions in the Chrome, then it is going to help you a lot. When you open a new website, all these extensions starts working on that websites; they consume RAM and Processor to do the desired job. When you open a few more tabs, you will feel it. Your PC becomes sluggish and unresponsive. Now you can enable a particular extension when you want it to do the job. It will not consume the resources on the websites that you don’t want the extension to run.
