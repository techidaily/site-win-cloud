Malware is a broad term used to define the [different malicious programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or codes designed to exploit the computer systems, networks, or any other programmable devices such as IoT based devices. The term malware is actually short for **Mal**icious Soft**ware.**

A malware program can infiltrate into your device without your knowledge to extract private data, financial data, hack the network, or simply damage the system. So, in general, the malware programs are intended for performing various illegitimate tasks for different gains. But what does a particular malware such as ransomware or spyware do?

## Is Malware and Virus the same?

Many people, even in the IT field, reciprocally use the terms virus and malware, but technically they are not the same. A virus is actually a type of malware. In the older times, the only malware was the virus, but when the varieties of malicious software increases, the cybersecurity experts started referring them all with the broader term – malware.

However, in the mind of the common people, any malicious program that harms their system is still a virus because they are unaware of the other technical terms. But the fact is, all viruses are the malware, but not all malware are the viruses.

## Common Malware Types and What do they do

Malware programs are of several types, all designed to perform the particular maligned task. No matter which type, all malware programs follow the basic pattern: **getting into the victim’s device without any suspicion and silently working on its goal for which it was made**.

The thing that differentiates the types of malware is what malicious tasks they perform and what model they follow to do that.

Let us find that out.

### **Virus**

![Computer Virus](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Computer-Virus-Malware.png)

A computer virus is basically **designed to replicate itself** and use the system’s computing power to put the load on it and eventually shut it down. It can also spread in the other systems through means such as Pendrive, sd cards, hard disks, network, etc. Some viruses can also act as the delivery agent for additional malware like trojans or spyware. The traditional threats, such as shortcut virus that you might have experienced on your older devices, are all [viruses](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

### **Trojan**

![Trojan Malware](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Trojan-Malware.png)

The trojan is another popular infection that most people have experienced or are familiar with. Its name is based on the ancient Greek story in which intruders enter the king’s palace in a gifted horse model. 

Similar to that story, the trojan malware takes control of the victim’s device **by presenting itself as a useful, legitimate program**. After the victim installs it, the trojan gets activated and silently works in the background conducting various malicious activities such as deleting, modifying, blocking, and copying the data by giving the backdoor [remote access to the cybercriminals](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). A trojan can also steal your banking information and download the other malware programs on the system. Further, some trojan programs are also used for the DDoS attacks on the targeted websites by sending multiple service requests simultaneously, thereby bringing down the server.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

[Ransomware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is considered one of the most dangerous malware programs. It is because mostly, **[prevention](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is the only cure for it**.

After entering into the victim’s system, ransomware would lock all the files and folders with a strong encrypting algorithm and ask the ransom from the victim in return for the decrypting key or tool. So basically, a ransomware attack is similar to a real-world kidnapping crime.

![Hijacker Malware](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hijacker-Malware.png)

The main aim of the browser hijackers is to illegitimately promote the affiliated webpages for the revenue generation.

First, the attacker attacks a few systems using malicious ‘bots.’ These bots further infect other devices and add them to the network. The botnet can be used for carrying out many illegal activities such a using the collective computation power for cryptocurrency mining, sending spam emails to thousands of users at the same time, carrying out DDoS attacks, and much more.
