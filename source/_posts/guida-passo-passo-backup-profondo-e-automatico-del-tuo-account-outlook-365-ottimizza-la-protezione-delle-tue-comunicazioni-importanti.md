### Image Your Computer with Norton Ghost

1\. Install Norton Ghost and open it. It will run a step-by-step wizard the first time you open it. At last, you will see the **Easy Setup** interface where you can create a backup at once. You can also click the **Cancel** option and set the backup task later.

2\. On the Home screen, you can create a backup task by clicking **Define Backup Wizard** or **Run or Manage Backups**. Here we choose the latter one.

[![Create Backup](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/create-backup.png)

3\. The **Easy Setup** screen will appear.

* You can click **OK** to accept the default settings or click a setting to modify it.
* Or you can click **Custom...** to create a backup according to your needs.

[![Click Custom](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/click-custom.png)

4\. Finally, click **OK** to confirm.

### Restore Image with Norton Ghost

Click **Recover My Files** if you want to recover files or folder, or **Recover My Computer** to make it.

**Recover My Files:**

1\. On **Recover My Files** screen, you can find the files you want to restore through **File and Folder** & **Recovery Point**.

2\. Whichever you choose, you can type the file name you need in the box under **Find files to recover** and click **Search** to find it.

[![Recover My Files](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/find-files-to-recover.png)

3\. After the scanning, select the file you need and click **Recover Files...**

**Recover My Computer:**

On **Recover My Computer** screen, find and choose the right system restore point and click **Recover Now** to make it.

### Clone Disk with Norton Ghost

1\. Connect your new hard drive to your computer.

2\. On the **Tools** page, click **Copy My Hard Drive** and follow the steps in the wizard to copy the drive.

👉 **Note:** The drivers that are used to run the hardware on one computer will likely not match the drivers on a second computer. So you’d better not use the Copy Drive feature to set up a hard drive that will be used in another computer.
