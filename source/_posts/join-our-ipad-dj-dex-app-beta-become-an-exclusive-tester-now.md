**DJ DEX is nearly ready to submit to the Apple App Store for approval — but we could use a little extra testing by you, our customer, first!**

[DJ DEX](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) for iOS has been completely revamped from soup to nuts, now utilizing the same core code found in the latest Windows/MAC version of DEX 3 Pro. It’s truly a full fledged DJ mixing application for your iPad with various new modes (interfaces) and features. DJ DEX is designed for live performance — so whether you use it as your main DJ application for your events or as a reliable backup, it’s equipped with everything you need to rock a party.
