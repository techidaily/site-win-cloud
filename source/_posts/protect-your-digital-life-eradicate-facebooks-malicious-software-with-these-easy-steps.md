## What is Facebook Malware?

Facebook malware is a type of malicious software that is designed to steal your personal information or hijack your account. It can come in the form of a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or spyware. Hackers will often use phishing techniques to trick you into clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious file. Once the malware is on your computer, it can spread to your friends’ computers by sending them spam messages or infecting their Facebook accounts.

Apart from that, Facebook malware can also be used to collect your personal information, such as your name, address, and credit card number. This information can then be used to steal your identity or make fraudulent charges on your account.

## How to Spot Facebook Malware?

Although there are many Facebook viruses and scams, you can easily protect yourself from them if you understand how to recognize them.

Here are the top ways the Facebook malware is spread:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### From a Message

Most of the time, Facebook malware comes in the form of a message or post from one of your friends. The message may look harmless at first, but it will usually contain a link that leads to a malicious website. Once you click on the link, the malware will be downloaded onto your computer.

### From a Fake Facebook App

Another way that Facebook malware is spread is through fake Facebook apps. These apps are usually created by hackers and are used to collect your personal information. To avoid falling for this scam, only download apps from the official Facebook app store.

### From a Third-Party Website

Hackers will also create fake websites that look like real Facebook websites. When you enter your login information on these websites, the hackers will be able to steal your password and take over your account. To avoid falling for this scam, only log in to Facebook from the official website.

### Facebook Video Virus

There have also been cases of Facebook viruses being spread through videos. The virus will usually be embedded in the video itself and will start to download onto your computer as soon as you start playing the video.

Other than that, the virus can also be spread through video links that are posted on Facebook. When you click on the link, you will be redirected to a malicious website that will download the virus onto your computer.

### From General Spam Posts

Another popular way to spread malware is by posting spam on Facebook. These posts usually contain links to malicious websites or downloads. They may also contain fake offers or deals that are designed to trick you into clicking on them. Once clicked, you will be taken to a malicious website or malware will be downloaded to your computer.

## What to do if your Facebook Account is Hacked?

If you think your [Facebook account](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) has been hacked, here are a few things you can do:

1. Change your password immediately
2. Check your recent login activity to see if there are any unfamiliar logins
3. If you use Facebook login for any other apps or websites, log out of those accounts and change your passwords
4. Contact Facebook’s help center to report the issue

Keep in mind that these steps won’t necessarily remove the hacker from your account, but they will prevent them from accessing it in the future.

## How to Remove Facebook Malware?

If you think your computer has been infected with Facebook malware, don’t panic! There are a few simple steps you can take to remove the malware and protect your computer from future infections.

### Scan your System for Malware

The first thing you need to do is run a virus scan on your computer. This will help to identify and remove any malicious files that may be on your system. You can use a free virus scanner, such as Microsoft Defender, or a paid one, such as Norton Antivirus. Once the scan is complete, you should delete any files that are flagged as being malicious.

### Change your Facebook Password

After you have removed the malware from your computer, you should change your Facebook password. This will help to prevent the hackers from taking over your account again. To change your password, go to the “Security and Login” section of Facebook and click on the “Change Password” button.

### Uninstall Unknown Apps from the Device

If you have any apps on your device that you don’t recognize, you should uninstall them immediately.
