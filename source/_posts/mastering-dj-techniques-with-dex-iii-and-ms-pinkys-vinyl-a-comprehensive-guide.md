[![](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mspinky-coverimage.jpg?resize=550%2C317&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mspinky-coverimage.jpg?fit=550%2C317&ssl=1 "mspinky-coverimage")

As you likely know our top [DJ program](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) for mixing video and audio is DEX 3\. What you may not know is that [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) supports control vinyl from Ms Pinky, allowing you to use turntables to control DEX 3 playback.

Ms Pinky’s vinyl system is unique, and one of the most advanced vinyl control system on the market. _From Ms Pinky’s site:_

> _Instead of music for human ears, Ms Pinky’s vinyl records contain special signals meant for the “ears” of a computer. As the needle traces the groove, Ms Pinky’s software listens to the sound coming from the record player and calculates instantly the velocity, direction, and physical position of the needle on the surface of the record. A few raw facts about Ms Pinky’s vinyl:_
> 
> _1) There are approximately 155 totally unique physical position stamps per rotation of the record. These physical position stamps can be read by the software whether the record is spinning in the forward direction, or in reverse._
> 
> _2) The duration of record playback at 33-1/3 rpm is 12 minutes 40 seconds per side, and each side of the record has unique position stamps._
> 
> _3) Ms Pinky’s software reads a new physical position stamp every 11.6 milliseconds when the record is played at 33-1/3 rpm._
> 
> _4) Ms Pinky’s software reads new velocity and direction information every 0.725 milliseconds._

What that boils down to is very precise control over the DJ software you use with Ms Pinky Vinyl – so whether you’re mixing audio or music videos with DEX 3 you can expect no latency cueing and scratching. Yes, this means you can indeed scratch and manipulate videos with turntables and Ms Pinky’s vinyl (_or Torq Vinyl if you can still find it, which was version 4 of Ms Pinky’s vinyl_).

In order to use DEX 3 with Ms Pinky Vinyl _**[you’ll need a few things](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)**_ including a two stereo input and two stereo output ASIO/Core Audio supported audio interface. You can purchase Ms Pinky Control Vinyl from **MsPinky.com [HERE](http://mspinky.com/store-front/)**
