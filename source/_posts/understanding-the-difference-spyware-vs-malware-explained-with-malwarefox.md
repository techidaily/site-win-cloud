## What is Malware?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/computer.png "computer")

As mentioned above, malware is the contraction of “**malicious software**“. It is any piece of software that was developed to cause harm to people, devices, and data. It is an umbrella term for any software which intentionally inflicts damages to systems. A hacker, a criminal organization, and even government agencies looking into data in computers can create malware.

### Examples of Malware

There are several types of malware around. A popular kind of malicious software is the virus. It is typically an executable file that can spread uncontrollably. It can damage a system’s core functionality or corrupt and delete files on your computer. One such famous virus is the [“I Love You” virus](http://money.cnn.com/2000/05/05/technology/loveyou/) which spread in 2000.

Another dangerous type of malware is ransomware. Others may also know it as scareware. It is purely created to monetize malware as it spreads directly. When ransomware downloads on your system, it will begin to lock the computer and even encrypt necessary files. Some might even threaten to erase all the data on the computer. The computer can only be released and decrypted when a ransom is paid typically using a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. The last few years saw the worst of ransomware such as [CryptoLocker](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/youre-infected-if-you-want-to-see-your-data-again-pay-us-300-in-bitcoins/) and [WannaCry](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

The most common type of malware that you probably encounter on a daily basis is adware. It is a type of aggressive advertising campaign to push products to consumers. Read more about [adware here](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

### Signs that your Computer is Malware-Infected

There are tell-tale signs that your computer is malware-infected beyond the detection of your anti-malware. A noticeable slowing down of your computer is one visible signal. It is especially noticeable if you have a few software running but the computer is running quite slow.

Moreover, pop-up messages, annoying ads, and strange changes in your browser is due to infection by malware. Anything that disrupts your usual workflow will need a more in-depth investigation. A thorough scan using your security suite might save your computer from further damage.

## What is Spyware?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/detective.png "detective")

Spyware is a type of malware with a specific purpose. Just as its name suggests, the primary goal is to spy and monitor activities and data on the computer and its users. It lives on the computer and tries to be as undiscoverable as possible. The longer it can remain in the machine, the more information it can collect. Most spyware is small enough to fly under the radar which means it is less likely to use many resources and processes. Because of this, it is harder to discover and identify.

The danger lies in its ability to discover personal and confidential information. The ubiquitous nature of computers and the Internet made most people careless about their data. Most users will not think twice about sharing and storing sensitive data in their computers. Financial documents, intimate photos, and login information are left on the computer without any encryption or security protection in check.

It is what hackers and criminals are waiting to exploit. As it scans the computer and waits for sensitive information, it continuously sends the data it collects to a third-party server where criminals can access your information at will.

### Examples of Spyware

Unlike most popular malware, spyware usually ships with seemingly legitimate software. The most common examples are the proliferation of fake antivirus products. Some may even pretend to be anti-spyware programs that fool users quite easily.

Some offenders are [WinFixer](https://www.symantec.com/security%5Fresponse/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-120121-2151-99), [MS Antivirus](https://www.secureworks.com/research/rogue-antivirus-part-2), [ExpertAntiVirus](https://www.symantec.com/security%5Fresponse/writeup.jsp?docid=2007-050111-3914-99&tabid=2), and [MacSweeper](https://www.symantec.com/security%5Fresponse/writeup.jsp?docid=2008-011613-5206-99). These anti-spyware programs will pretend to scan your computer for spyware while collecting information the entire time.

### Signs that your Computer is Spyware-Infected

While it is difficult to identify if your computer has a spyware infection, there are things to observe. Spyware programs try to use the least resources as possible. However, careful observation of the processes in your computer will reveal questionable programs running alongside your apps.

Moreover, what spyware cannot hide is its communication with the server where it sends the information it collects. It is best to use a [network monitoring tool](https://www.windowschimp.com/internet-traffic-monitoring-tools/#comment-25045) to check if an application is continuously using your bandwidth. Some can even identify which apps are using the most bandwidth.

## How Spyware and other Malware Work Together

More often than not, spyware will not stay on your computer for long and gather information. Some spyware may not collect enough confidential information such as bank accounts. However, it can open vulnerabilities in the computer for other malware to take advantage.

The information collected by the spyware can lead to being [scammed](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Some may even make way for adware to get into the PC which can steal precious resources. With enough information, some may collect information about your computer’s vulnerabilities which ransomware can exploit such as WannaCry Ransomware.
