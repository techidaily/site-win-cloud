## What is “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT”?

PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT is a fake pop-up warning message sent by cyberattackers claiming to be from Microsoft. Such fraudulent warnings are intended to frighten users and deceive them into calling a fake technical support number, install a phony virus remover, and a one-time for the technical service provided. This is what the message says:

> _PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT_
> 
> _This computer has been LOCKED._
> 
> _Do not close this window or restart your computer without calling support._
> 
> _We have locked this computer for your security._
> 
> _You have been browsing unsafe pornographic websites._
> 
> _Your computer has been infected._
> 
> _Contact the Microsoft helpline to reactivate your computer._
> 
> _Failure to call will result in a notice being sent to your residence._

When this pop-up appears on the browser screen, users are redirected to a phony page of Microsoft that contains a fake helpline number. After seeing such a message, many users get frightened and follow the instructions of the pop-up, i.e., call the given fake helpline number of Microsoft. On reaching the given number, the cyber attacker pretending to be a technician would ask the caller to download and install a fake antivirus program, which is, in reality, a malicious program that can be anything like Trojan, Spyware, Ransomware, Adware, or others.

There could be various reasons users might get such fake alerts in the form of pop-ups.

## Why did I get the “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT” Pop-Up?

If you see the “PORNOGRAPHIC VIRUS ALERT FROM MICROSOFT” pop-up message on your screen, it might be because of one of the following reasons:

* You might have visited an infected website while looking for freeware or similar things on the internet.
* Your system might be infected with an Adware program, which is causing the irrelevant ads and pop-ups on your browsing screen.
* The browser you are using might be tainted with ill-disposed malware known as Browser Hijacker. A browser hijacker can take control of your browser’s settings and redirect you to infected sites.
* Many users blindly install the software programs without unchecking the bundled programs that come with the installer. Cybercriminals often introduce malware such as Adware and trojans through the bundled programs.
