## What is Apple Security Alert Scam?

Have you ever witnessed a pop-up message that says your Mac has been hacked? This is the Apple Security Alert scam. It is a fake notification that tricks you into believing that your system and personal information are at risk. Moreover, if you have downloaded free software or other third-party file downloads, then your Mac might get affected. 

The fake pop-up is designed in a way that you give away your personal information, which can be later used as a threat. However, it is necessary to know that Apple does not send any security warnings, and the notifications are a trap. 

In the past, other reputed companies like [Google](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), [FastSupport](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), [Norton](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and more have been impersonated by the cyber criminals in the similar way.
