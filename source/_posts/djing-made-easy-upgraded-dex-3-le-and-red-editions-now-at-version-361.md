## DJing Made Easy: Upgraded DEX 3 LE & Red Editions Now at Version 3.6.1

[![DEX 3 LE and DEX 3 RE DJ Software Updates](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dex3ledex3re361-coverimage.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dex3ledex3re361-coverimage.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "DEX 3 LE and DEX 3 RE DJ software Updates")

**New updates for both DEX 3 LE, our free DJ mixing software application, and DEX 3 RE (Red Edition) are ready for download.**

We love to tweak our [DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) engine to attain perfection as much as you love to tweak the knobs on your [DJ controller](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) for that perfect mix. The 3.6.1 update to both DEX 3 LE, our totally **[free DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)**, and DEX 3 RE, our mixing software aimed at the needs of Mobile DJs that require precision 2-deck mixing, is all about **performance and stability**.

So yeah, it may not be as exciting as with feature-loaded updates but this is an update you will _feel_ during live performance.

**There’s nothing more important than having precise, reliable control** whether you’re mixing for friends or creating on-the-fly mashups at a club in front of thousands. As creators of software designed for live performance it’s paramount we create software you can trust, in any situation and any venue. This update further solidifies the foundation that all other features are built upon.
